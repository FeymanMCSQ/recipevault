Design Intent

RecipeVault now adopts a High Culinary Card Aesthetic inspired by archival French culinary index cards:

restrained

typographic

paper-like

elegant

deliberate

minimal color

high whitespace

no bright UI chrome

The UI should feel:

“Printed. Composed. Timeless.”

Not:

“Startup dashboard with green buttons.”

1. Visual Principles
1.1 Material Feel

Warm ivory / parchment background

Slight paper grain texture (subtle, optional)

No pure white (#ffffff banned for primary surfaces)

No strong gradients

1.2 Color Palette (Restricted)

Primary surface:

#F3EFE7 (ivory)

#E8E1D6 (muted parchment)

Text:

#1E1E1C (deep charcoal)

#4B463F (muted brown-gray)

Accent:

#6C2E2E (deep wine red)

Optional muted olive: #5A6146

Forbidden:

bright green

neon anything

heavy blues

2. Typography Rules

Primary font:

Serif (e.g., Playfair Display, Cormorant, EB Garamond)

Secondary font:

Elegant humanist sans (Inter, Geist — only for metadata)

Rules:

Recipe title: large serif, generous letter-spacing

Section headers: small caps serif or refined uppercase

Body text: serif

Metadata (tags/date): subtle, muted, smaller sans

Forbidden:

Bold everywhere

All-caps shouting

UI-style heavy buttons

3. Layout Structure

Each recipe must resemble a physical recipe card:

Layout hierarchy:

Title (centered or slightly offset)

Source metadata (small, muted)

Divider line (thin, understated)

Ingredients block

Divider

Notes block

Spacing must be generous.

No boxed sections.
No heavy shadows.
No dashboard panels.

4. UI Element Rules
Buttons

No bright filled buttons.

Use:

subtle outline buttons

or text buttons with underline on hover

Border radius small (2–4px max)

No rounded-pill modern SaaS look

Tags

No green chips.

Replace with:

muted pill with thin border

or small uppercase labels separated by dot

Example aesthetic:
soup · lentils · weeknight

5. Interaction Tone

Animations:

150–200ms fade

No bounce

No scale-pop

Hover:

Slight underline or slight color deepen

Not glow

6. Forbidden Patterns (Hard Ban)

Gradient buttons

Drop-shadow cards

3D elevation panels

Colored backgrounds behind each section

Vibrant call-to-action blocks

Overuse of icons
